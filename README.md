# Shinobi Blog

This is a simple blog application called **Shinobi**, built as a starter project for a Claude Code crash course. The application demonstrates modern web development practices using Next.js and serves as a foundation for learning AI-assisted development with Claude Code.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Claude Code

This project serves as a practical example for learning Claude Code capabilities:

### Core Features

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Use Claude Code to make intelligent edits, refactor code, and add new features
- **CLAUDE.md Files**: Learn to create and maintain CLAUDE.md files for project context and memory
- **GitHub Integration**: Practice using Claude Code with GitHub workflows, PR reviews, and issue management
- **Slash Commands**: Explore built-in slash commands for quick actions and navigation
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Create and configure custom slash commands for project-specific workflows
  - `/merged`: Clean up after PR merge by switching to main, pulling changes, and deleting the merged branch
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Integrate with MCP servers for extended functionality

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how to work collaboratively with AI on real projects
- Master Claude Code's file editing and code generation capabilities
- Learn best practices for maintaining AI context in larger codebases
- Explore automation possibilities with GitHub Actions and Claude Code
- Practice iterative development with AI assistance

## Running the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Final Thoughts

### Check the Code Yourself

- AI Can make mistakes.
- Checking the code keeps you in the loop.

### Context is Key

- Be smart about what context you provide.
- Keep it relevant & the history lean where possible.
- Use /clear and /compact commands.

### Don't rely on AI to do EVERYTHING

- It will make you lazy!
- You'll find it harder to learn new skills.

### AI in Coding will Bring More Opportunity

- More areas to specialize - MCP, Agentic tools, Custom integrations, etc
- There will still be a demand for good programmers.
- Learning to code is more important than ever!

### Important commands

/clear - clears whole session
/compact - compact the sessino
Esc twice - choose from prev sessions
/resume - shows all sessions

- Context window in claude can handle 200k tokens
  /plan

1. Can you make a avatar like component(no pic, only initials) and find any places in the project where it can replace avatar like template?

/agents

1. Expert UI & UX engineer who reviews the UI & UX of React components in a browser using Playwright, takes screenshots, then offers feedback on how to improve the component in terms of visual design, user experience and accessibility.

/install-github
/rename - rename a session
claude --resume auth-refactor

claude --worktree feature/a....
git worktree add ui-updates
git worktree remove ui-updates
! bash mode

- worktree : checking out multiple branches at a time

### MCP Servers

MCP servers help AI model connect to external sources.
For example: Supabase MCP would allow Claude to read blogs table in supabase, make an interface to model the records. The supabase server would provide the ability to claude to call those tools.
